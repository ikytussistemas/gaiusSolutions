## Follow-up Questions

## How long did you spend on the test? 
`I had problems with the API available, CORS error, because of that I spent approximately 5 hours to finish the test.`

## What would you add if you had more time? 
`It would improve the user interface and the separation of responsibilities from parts of the code.`

## How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume? 
`I had problems using the forwarded API and decided to simulate HTTP calls directly from the application from the data provided, to deliver what was requested at the right time. However, it would add the possibility of adding / editing new products and promotions to improve product testing.`

## What did you find most difficult? 
`Build business rules from the available data.`

## How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?
`I really enjoyed participating in this test, I have already developed some apps for gyms, but it is challenging and exciting to think of an app from some data and try to present the best solution in a course of time and without knowing who are the possible users. I hope to advance in the selection and evolve in my career.`
